## Adding a Dictionary
To add a dictionary you can import an xml file in the following format:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<dictionary>
  <title>Title</title>
  <words>
    <word>
      <text>Word text</text>
      <pronunciation>Pronunciation</pronunciation>
      <definition>Definition</definition>
    </word>
  </words>
<dictionary>
```
Note that it is assumed that the words are in order of commonality. The first word is the most common, the last word is the least common. The pronunciation tag is optional.
